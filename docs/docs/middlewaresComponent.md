# **Middlewares**

In the context of `AzureServiceBusFlow`, **Middlewares** are components that run before a message is sent to Azure Service Bus.

They allow you to intercept, inspect, or modify the ServiceBusMessage ‚Äî for example, adding custom properties, performing logging, or applying transformations ‚Äî without changing the core sending logic.

Each middleware **executes in sequence** through a pipeline, and after all have finished, the message is finally delivered to Azure Service Bus.

## üß© Middleware Interface

AsbFlow defines a interface for creating custom middlewares. 

```csharp
public interface IProducerMiddleware
{
    Task InvokeAsync(ServiceBusMessage message, Func<Task> next);
}
```

This interface defines a single method, InvokeAsync, which receives:

- The `ServiceBusMessage` being processed.
- A delegate `next`, which represents the next middleware in the pipeline or the final send operation.

<br>

### üß± Example of Middleware
```csharp
public class AsbSampleMiddleware : IProducerMiddleware
{
    public async Task InvokeAsync(ServiceBusMessage message, Func<Task> next)
    {
        // Add a custom property if it doesn't exist
        if (!message.ApplicationProperties.ContainsKey("SampleMiddleware"))
        {
            message.ApplicationProperties["SampleMiddleware"] = "Executed";
        }

        // Add a UTC timestamp for debugging or tracking
        message.ApplicationProperties["ProcessedAtUtc"] = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("O");

        // Continue the pipeline (invoke the next middleware or the actual send)
        await next();
    }
}
``` 
This sample middleware demonstrates how to enrich a message before it is published.
It adds two custom properties:

- `"SampleMiddleware"` ‚Äì a flag indicating that the middleware has executed.
- `"ProcessedAtUtc"` ‚Äì a timestamp showing when the message was processed.

By calling `await next()`, it ensures the next middleware (or the send operation) is executed, maintaining the correct order of the pipeline.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Registering the Middleware in the Pipeline

Once your middleware is implemented, you can easily register it in the producer pipeline through the UseMiddleware<TMiddleware>() extension method in your Program.cs:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAzureServiceBus(cfg => cfg
    .ConfigureAzureServiceBus(azureServiceBusConfig)
    .AddProducer<ExampleCommand1>(p => p
        .EnsureQueueExists("command-queue-one")
        .WithCommandProducer()
        .UseMiddleware<AsbSampleMiddleware>()
        .ToQueue("command-queue-one")));
```

In this example:

The `AsbSampleMiddleware` will be executed every time a message is produced for the queue command-queue-one.

Multiple middlewares can be chained by calling UseMiddleware multiple times ‚Äî they are executed in the same order they are added.
