# AzureServiceBusFlow

**AzureServiceBusFlow** (or **AsbFlow**) is a lightweight and fluent integration library for **Azure Service Bus**, designed to simplify and standardize message-based communication in .NET applications.

Inspired by the configuration style and modular design of [KafkaFlow](https://github.com/Farfetch/kafkaflow), **AsbFlow** provides a clean, extensible API that helps developers easily configure producers, consumers, topics, queues, and subscriptions â€” without repetitive boilerplate code.


## âœ¨ Features

- Fluent configuration for Azure Service Bus resources  
- Automatic creation of topics, queues, and subscriptions  
- Producer and consumer abstraction layers  
- Built-in dependency injection support  
- Structured logging with `ILogger` integration
